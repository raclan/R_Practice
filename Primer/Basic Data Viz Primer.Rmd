## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mpg}
mpg
# displ: car's engine size in liters
# hwy: car's fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon
```
```{r plot}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
# Start the graph with ggplot()
# Add elements to the graph with a geom_ function
# Select variables with the mapping = aes() argument
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
# '+' needs to come at the end of line, not beginning
# ?function_name
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
# color, size, alpha, shape
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue", shape = 3, alpha = 0.5)
# to change graph aesthetic, put outside of parentheses; to tie it to variable, put inside
# ?geom_line
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
# ?geom_smooth

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
